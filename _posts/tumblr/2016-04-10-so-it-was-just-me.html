<p>I spent a while on a little project trying to nail down why some values in an array in Javascript kept getting updated. I found every place where values in the array are assigned (one) and referenced (more). After commenting out more and more lines, I limited it down to a section where the array wasn’t referenced at all! But another array, which was “copied” from the first, was manipulated.</p><p>Oh. I guess arrays are just pointers and I learned more about (the basics of?) Javascript. It kinda feels like German, where I use(d) it a bunch without formal training. That’s good for like 70% conversations, but finally taking a class forced me to actually use concepts like <i>grammar</i>. Maybe I should formally learn Javascript.</p>
