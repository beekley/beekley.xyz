I was always a little skeptical about flashing my phone since I expected it to be a risky procedure involving careful backups, well-placed commands and security workarounds. Well it was as easy as downloading an app and hitting &ldquo;Install&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe <em>It Just Works</em>.</p>
