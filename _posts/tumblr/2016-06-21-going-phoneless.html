<p>My Nexus 5′s power button stopped working about a month ago (<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/208337/How+do+I+fix+a+Nexus+5+Power+Button+Issue">a common </a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus5/comments/2rpfuj/nexus_5_broken_power_button_keeps_rebooting/">problem</a>, <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/general/nexus-5-power-button-broken-heres-to-t3049747">it seems</a>). After a quick call to Google CS and reminder that I’m out of warranty, I decided to take the opportunity to try living without a phone.</p><p>It’s been&hellip; actually really easy. I use Google Voice for my phone number, so I can get texts and calls from any device that I’m logged in to. But the other reason I think it’s been fine is that I realized that there a few major “categories” of my time:</p><ol><li>When I am near my computer or iPad with internet</li><li>When I am with other people who have phones</li><li>When I’m not near internet or people I know, but don’t need to be in communication</li><li>When I’m not near internet or people I know, and I do need to be in communication</li></ol><p>The first is most of the time when I’m at home or at work. The second starts the moment I encounter the first person I’m meeting with outside of number one. The last two are what surprised me. </p><p>Everyone thinks that being without a phone is an impossible task because we use it so much in our idle time. That was me a month ago, browsing the internet or chatting as I walked to the car or between sets at the gym. But after an incredulously short time, I stopped missing having my phone for these moments. Although there are still things that are put into the fourth category (largely when driving in case of an emergency), I found that almost everything not in the first two can fit into the third.</p><p>(I’d say that being phoneless has contributed to posting on here more often. I read more and have more time to think and come up with stuff I want to talk about)</p><p>That said, I got a backup phone (thanks, Tesia!) and have some replacement power buttons on the way to try to fix it myself. It looks like a fun little project, but I am going to rethink what role a phone has in the small moments of my life.</p><figure data-orig-width="753" data-orig-height="294" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/bb3c7c5dd3f7ead2e2ddb7cced1c050b/tumblr_inline_o8z6jwlqSo1qb9570_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="753" data-orig-height="294"/></figure>
