<p>I started reading Sandor Katz&rsquo;s bookÂ <em>The Art of Fermentation</em> to give me some insight into future hobby General Fermentation. My first batched of ginger ale were based on internet scouring and compilation of recipes. But Katz likes the do things a little more authentically, using ginger bug from the wild yeasts on the ginger skins. I&rsquo;m pretty curious how that will turn out and will keep it in mind for Batch #4.</p>
<p><em>The Art</em> will also advise me on endeavors such as vinegar-making. I&rsquo;ve got a bottle of Charles Shaw&rsquo;s finest ready to be converted to acetic acid.</p>
