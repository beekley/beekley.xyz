<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_mu2td7ZMpp1sqtw1fo1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>This is far from the most beautiful thing I&rsquo;ve made, but it&rsquo;s my first batch (in CA) of homebrew ginger ale. Nothing but ginger, sugar, lemon, champagne yeast and a week of fermentation time.Â </p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been letting off too much air to keep the pressure down. It&rsquo;s really not carbonating, though it&rsquo;s definitely getting dryer. It also doesn&rsquo;t seem sweet or ginger-y enough, but I&rsquo;m wondering if carbonation affects the way we taste that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping a log of recipes and will iterate towards refreshing perfection.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul><li>1.7oz chopped ginger</li>
<li>9oz white sugar</li>
<li>1oz brown sugar</li>
<li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
<li>1 cup water for syrup</li>
<li>1/8 tsp yeast (prepared in 1/4cup warm water)</li>
<li>6 cups total water</li>
</ul><p><span>Mix over low heat sugar, ginger and 1 cup water for up to 1 hour. Let cool and combine with the yeast remaining water. Let sit in the shade for 1-2 days, then </span>refrigerate for at least 5 more days, letting off pressure occasionally.</p>
