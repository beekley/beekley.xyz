After two weeks bottled at room temperature, I put it in the fridge to cool and ultimately drink.</p><p>Now I’ve had it and it tastes like drinking raw ginger. Slightly alcoholic raw ginger, but I’m not sure if there’s a little boozey warmth or that’s just the overwhelming ginger burn. It’s very dry and actually pretty flat. I wonder if the flip top bottles I used maintain a good seal after reuse, or if I just didn’t add enough priming sugar.</p><p>To make it drinkable I have a few things I want to do:</p><ul><li>Dilute. I’m thinking of watering it down maybe by half to decrease the ginger-per-sip rate.<br/></li><li>Recarbonate. It’s flat, so I want to redo the carbonation process, likely with more sugar.<br/></li><li>Sweeten. I plan to cut bottle fermentation down to a week or so, possibly by pasteurization if I’m feeling dangerous, in order to keep some of the sugar in there.</li></ul><p>But I am satisfied that I was able to make a strongly spiced brewed ginger ale! Hopefully it’ll be drinkable after the next steps, but experimentation is fun even without a product (I say that now, but not back when doing my thesis&hellip;)</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3200" data-orig-width="2368"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/5f6ded504ff4fd3bc8f9815dffc81d05/tumblr_inline_o65oh31ybx1qb9570_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3200" data-orig-width="2368"/></figure>
