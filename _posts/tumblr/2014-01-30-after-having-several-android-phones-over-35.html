<p>After having several Android phones over 3.5 years, plus being a Google Apps (gmail, etc) user for forever, I&rsquo;ve grown to enjoy what Google makes. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I <em>like</em> Google. But it&rsquo;s also hard for me to say what I dislike about their products, services, philosophy, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to say this, because I don&rsquo;t mind when other companies (Apple)Â do this, but one problem I have is Google&rsquo;s insistence that it knows what I want best. I recently had to turn off Location Services on my phone because Google would give me public transit directions to some place hours away in Marin. I would dismiss it multiple times per day, yet it would return that evening, the next morning and repeat. I&rsquo;m disappointed, because I really enjoyed the feature of seeing the public transit schedule home and to work immediately on my phone each morning and evening. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to turn off a useful feature because Google&rsquo;s strong insistence that I really want to go somewhere else.</p>
<p>These kind of things are what prevent a lot of amazing features of Google services from really being, well, <em>amazing</em>.</p>
