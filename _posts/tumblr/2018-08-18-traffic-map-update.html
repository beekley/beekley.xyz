<p>It might be time to find our own place after 5 wonderful years in Sawtelle. Emma is about to start a new job in Alhambra and we’re looking for somewhere that is good for both of our commutes.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been (very casually) working on <a href="http://beekley.xyz/tagged/trafficmap">a script to gather traffic data</a> to help us determine where would be a good place to live. It’s now in a v1 state and ready to be used by any and all! <a href="https://github.com/beekley/TrafficMap">Check it out on GitHub</a>&ndash; the readme should describe how to use it.</p><p>Now for some pretty pictures! The following is a contour map of estimated travel time to Emma’s new job at 7:00 am on a Wednesday aggregated with time coming back at 5:30 pm.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1454" data-orig-width="2320"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/9c64dfc880a449cd2e0b04a0d10692bf/tumblr_inline_pdo618cbxX1qb9570_540.png" data-orig-height="1454" data-orig-width="2320"/></figure><p>Next is the bike time to/from my job.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1465" data-orig-width="2322"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/abfededadc23ce9f7f226c8c48409c22/tumblr_inline_pdo638NX6I1qb9570_540.png" data-orig-height="1465" data-orig-width="2322"/></figure><p>And finally the two combined!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1458" data-orig-width="2327"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/08f0a98121e22008c96bdd829974a4c6/tumblr_inline_pdo62eOFvA1qb9570_540.png" data-orig-height="1458" data-orig-width="2327"/></figure><p>Some commentary:</p><p>* There are some artifacts where the data point landed on a freeway. Driving duration is disproportionately low at these points and biking duration doesn’t exist (which I set to -1).</p><p>* The minima are pretty close to my job. My theory is that, since biking is slower than driving, the biking data curves down out the driving data.</p><p>* East Culver City is the equi-temporal area for our two commutes (but pretty far from a minimum)</p><p>* We’ll probably live in the Palms or Ocean Park areas since that would save us ~30-40 mins per day from our current location. Also we really like the locations (commute time isn’t everything!). </p>
