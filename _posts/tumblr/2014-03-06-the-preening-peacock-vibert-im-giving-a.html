<p>I&rsquo;m giving a presentation on characterization of lake pigments in paintings today and fell in love with this piece. It&rsquo;s a beautiful protest against the church in the 19th century that portrays his view of the clergy in facial expression. Oh and the red lake pigment makes the robes very stunning.</p>
