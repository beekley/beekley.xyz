<p><a href="http://uncncntrtd.com/post/146074304736/losing-tic-tac-toe-algorithmically">I posted about building a big decision tree</a> that proved that player 2 could force a win by player 1 in tic tac toe. Turns out I was reading my results incorrectly (a result of ”2″ at a node meant player 2 <i>could not </i>force a player 1 win). That sucks.</p><p>I have proven the inverse of my hypothesis, so that’s something! Next up to see if P2 can never win (so P1 wins or draws).</p>
