<p>So far, City Builder only does a few things:</p>
<ul><li>Generate a list of people with a distribution of wealths around an average, it </li>
<li>Build a grid of land plots with a base &ldquo;value&rdquo;</li>
<li>When a citizen is put into a plot, increase the value of the plots around it<!-- more --></li>
</ul><p>The steps today were to start the algorithm that decides where to place each citizen. It creates a list that contains all of the plots in the grid. As each plot is added to the list, a Probability Counter increments by the value of the plot. When a citizen is being place, a random number is generated, less than the end value of the counter. If the random number is &lt;=Vplot1 (value of the first plot), then the first plot is chose. If the number is &gt;Vplot1 but &lt;=(Vplot2+Vplot1) then the 2nd plot is chosen, and so on.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t completely finished, but the start is there.</p>
