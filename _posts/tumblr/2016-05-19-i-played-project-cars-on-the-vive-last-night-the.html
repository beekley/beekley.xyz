The visual immersion was cool, but what really made it was how each car felt to drive. It was a physical experience&ndash; I could feel each turn in my chest&ndash; and it gave the cars a weight that I’d never experienced in a game before. The weight distribution of the mid-engine BMW M1 (badass) felt different than the front-ish FR-S (also awesome) and the very front biased AMG SLS (oh god how do I control this thing). </p><p>The graphical fidelity just wasn’t super great, since even on my 980ti I had to turn settings down quite a bit. But the physical immersion was incredible and I’m about to fire it up again.</p>
