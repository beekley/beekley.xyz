Of the stuff I&rsquo;ve owned: I started with a pair of Brainwavz IEMs, which broke (well, they were $15) and SE115, which also broke (never buying IEMs without a replaceable cable&hellip;), followed by the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/378gfs/if_its_stupid_but_it_works_its_not_stupid_t70p/">DT770 and then T70p</a>. Finally, I traded for these Alpha Dogs and am finally happy with a pair of closed headphones.</p><p>Quick comparison with my HD600: The Alpha Dogs definitely dig lower, but that&rsquo;s not to say I don&rsquo;t like the HD600 bass. Highs on the alpha dogs are a bit, well, weird and I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting used to them. They have a surprisingly similar soundstage. The ADs are a lot bigger and heavier, but the pads are insanely comfortable. One note about the pads&ndash; I wear pretty thick glasses and noticed a pretty big difference in sound with and without them for the AD&rsquo;s, but no change for the HD600.</p><p>The ADs have better clarity almost all around, with maybe an exception in the highs. I have been listening to a lot of darker, low-end-focused music, and the AD&rsquo;s excel with it. But overall, I&rsquo;d probably still say I prefer the HD600.</p><p>Upradeitis is in remission.</p><p>(btw my monitor isn&rsquo;t broken, I just tried to garble it a little)</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/3lkgzs/a_winding_path_of_officefriendly_closed/">posted this on Reddit</a> after getting the Alpha Dogs almost a year ago. I still get excited every time I put them on.</p><p>The keyboard is a Ducky DK9008P. I’ve since swapped out the function keys with a sample pack of random colors from <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/">WASD</a> (shout out to them for doing that for me!)</p>
