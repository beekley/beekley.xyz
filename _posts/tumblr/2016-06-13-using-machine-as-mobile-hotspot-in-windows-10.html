There’s even <a href="https://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/">an open source tool</a> to help do this from a pretty GUI.</p><p>Waaay down in the search results (like, number 5 and therefore beyond the realm of exploration) is <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/use-your-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot">Microsoft’s own page on the topic</a>. Turns out there’s just a toggle in settings to do exactly what I need to do. It even generates a random and secure key for the network.</p><p>I could

say something about the convolution of Win10′s settings, but this was really just a search away in Windows itself. I’ve become trained to assume the best way to find how to do something in Win10 is to google and read a blog/forum post. Maybe I should stop that.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="520" data-orig-width="390"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/63e26d281d252afe3a4e34573216b88f/tumblr_inline_o8q36gYKuz1qb9570_540.png" data-orig-height="520" data-orig-width="390"/></figure>
