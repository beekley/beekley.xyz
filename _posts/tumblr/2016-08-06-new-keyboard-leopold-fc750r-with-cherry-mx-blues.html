I love the sharp click clack of blues and the PBT caps feel smooth and solid.</p><p>The Dell AT101W has served me well for two years and a thesis, but itâ€™s time to clear some space of the desk and move to a more modern switch. It works as well as (I imagine) it did when it was made in 1990.<br/></p>
