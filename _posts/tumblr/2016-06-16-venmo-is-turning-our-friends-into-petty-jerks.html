<a href="http://qz.com/687395/venmo-is-turning-our-friends-into-petty-jerks/">Venmo is turning our friends into petty jerks</a><br/><p>Venmo is wonderful. It&rsquo;s one, critical part of living my cashless dream. What I enjoy most about it is that it is that it sort of decentralizes payment, removing the need to have a physical means of currency transfer as long as a friend does. The other day, I wanted to grab some quick food before a movie&ndash; my friend got in line for the movie and bought tickets and I Venmoed him the money while I was waiting for food. (Actually, that&rsquo;s a lie. I still owe them money since I have no phone and therefore no Venmo. But the convenient solution existed!)</p><p>But this article highlights my main problem with it. I love having a relationship with people where we&rsquo;ll buy lunch or beer or whatever for each other, knowing that, over a long enough sample size, we&rsquo;ll average out to about even. It&rsquo;s almost like a national debt, where other countries (friends) are invested in your success because they/you owe you/them money.</p><p>Venmo allows us to get to that &ldquo;even&rdquo; point in real time! Which is cool! Also really annoying, and loses a component of trust that we had as friends.</p>
